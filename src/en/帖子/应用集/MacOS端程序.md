# MacOS端程序

## Preface

1. Utilize the website's directory or the browser's search functionality to locate the desired resources.
2. The underlying intention behind this collection is to facilitate a quicker reinstallation of the system for personal convenience. It primarily consists of streamlined and cracked versions of applications. **All the resources in this collection have been gathered from the internet and are shared freely.**
3. When excessive applications are installed or after switching system languages, the application sorting within Launchpad might become disordered. You can restore Launchpad to its default state by entering the following command in the terminal:
```bash
defaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool TRUE;killall Dock
```
4. To purchase Apple Store gift cards, you can utilize the [PockytShop](https://ur.alipay.com/_3XGfO0S4VxjNAVEYpUfAUy) mini program, which supports Alipay.
