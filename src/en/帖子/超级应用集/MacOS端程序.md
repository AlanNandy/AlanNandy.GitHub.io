# MacOS Applications

## Preface

1. Utilize the website's directory or the browser's search functionality to locate the desired resources.

2. The underlying intention behind this collection is to facilitate a quicker reinstallation of the system for personal convenience. It primarily consists of streamlined and cracked versions of applications. **All the resources in this collection have been gathered from the internet and are shared freely.**

3. When excessive applications are installed or after switching system languages, the application sorting within Launchpad might become disordered. You can restore Launchpad to its default state by entering the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    defaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool TRUE;killall Dock
    ```

4. Attention, if you receive a message stating that the file is damaged and cannot be installed, please open Terminal and enter the following command:
    ```bash
    sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine “file_path”
    ```

5. More Safari browser extensions can be compiled using the [Safari Use Chrome Extensions](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg5MDg3NzYwNg==&mid=2247484122&idx=1&sn=4232742cb84a9ad916f2b8e61b837b01&chksm=cfd4a113f8a328056db550cab3d96b1cebea05f7c817a19fe7b6eae79db4428648083c37e7b5#rd) method, but there may be stability issues. After downloading and extracting the file, move it to the Applications folder in Finder. Then, in Safari's "Develop" menu bar, allow unsigned extensions. Finally, open the extension and grant it permission to access websites.

6. To purchase Apple Store gift cards, you can utilize the [PockytShop](https://ur.alipay.com/_3XGfO0S4VxjNAVEYpUfAUy) mini program, which supports Alipay.
